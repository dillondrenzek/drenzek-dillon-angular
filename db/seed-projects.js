The colors don’t show up in his store except for in the extremely hot pink and hot orange shopping bags he uses. He explained the choice was a business decision because you can see the bags from a mile away (though he probably said kilometer). I thought that was clever, so I wanted to keep the pink and orange on the bags. My goal was to keep the pink and orange, but introduce another visual element: the stripes from the three crosswalks outside his door."

You are essentially handing yourself to someone in the form of a 50x85mm piece of paper and expect them to understand or at least remember who you are. Since this transaction is a chance for a personal connection, I decided to add a little sentiment in the form of a phrase meant to be reminiscent of the closing of a letter \"Keep In Touch, Storm.\""

I chose to use the same idea as the business card and include a little phrase to emphasize the personal side of a routine business transaction. It is meant to thank the customer for their business and let them know they are appreciated. By adding the sticker to the bag, Storm is saying \"you came to my store and I thank you, take this item with love, and feel welcome back at anytime.\""

It is often plainly colored with a simple symbol or message on the front, and this shirt would be no exception. However, this shirt is special because from far away, the shirt appears to be plain black, perhaps with five small white dots (the illegible letters) on the front. But as you approach the wearer into their personal range the pattern and text become legible and the shirt comes alive with its quality revealed."

Since the event was featuring other brands, my main goal was to give each company its time in the spotlight, but still recognize that they were part of the \"family.\" The idea hit me early on to have a model walking down the runway with an article of clothing from each company. Like individual parts becoming a whole, this would give each company their part but they also form Storm’s family."
