                <h3>Why Bicycles Get Right-of-Way on Campus</h3>

                    The age old question of roadway right-of-way is one of courtesy and safety, but in today's day and age, there seems to be some misunderstanding of the common courtesy (and sense) when pedestrians and bicycles meet.  Cars yield to bicycles simply because bicyclists have a higher risk of injury in the unfortunate case of a collision. But what about when you encounter pedestrians as you bicycle through crowded areas such as the middle of a college campus? It is my belief that pedestrians should also yield to bicycles for many very simple and very straightforward reasons.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>           
       <p> First, campus is huge. I couldn't possibly fathom walking between classes. As a freshman, I realized early on that bicycling was the only reasonable mode of transportation on campus. I once timed how long it would take me to walk from my class in Humanities all the way to my class – 10 minutes later –  in ATLAS 113. Once I added in the time it takes to get coffee at the library, I figured it would take me an astounding 15 minutes to walk that far! Bicycling is definitely the way to go, especially in the large crowds in the middle of the day.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>          
       <p> However, there becomes a problem in such large crowds. It is common knowledge that bicycles are very difficult to control at the walking pace many people use on sidewalks. You simply don't have the speed or momentum to keep the front tire straight, making it pretty difficult to avoid the many pedestrians also trying to use the sidewalk. This is where my point on right-of-way comes into play. <a id="read-more" href="dillondrenzek-belief-2.html">Read More ></a>
